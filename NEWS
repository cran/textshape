Versioning
----------

Releases will be numbered with the following semantic versioning format:

<major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor
  and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
  (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch



textshape 1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------


NEW FEATURES

* Users can now globally select a **tibble** output rather than a **data.table**
  output for all functions that outputted a **data.table**.  This can be set
  globally via `set_output`.  If the user does not set the output type
  **textshape** tries to infer based on whether or not the user has **dplyr**
  loaded.  If **dplyr** is loaded then *tibble* is the default output.

* `set_output` and `tibble_output` added to globally set the output type
  (**tibble** or **data.table**) and to check/infer the desired output type.


textshape 1.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES

* `bind_list`, `bind_table`, & `bind_vector` have been renamed to the more
  meaningful forms of `tidy_list`, `tidy_table`, & `tidy_vector`.  The former
  version are now deprecated.  This bumps the version to 1.0.0 as this is a
  major change that breaks backward compatibility.



textshape 0.1.0 - 0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------

NEW FEATURES

* `bind_list` added to `rbind` a `list` of named `data.frame`s or `vector`s.

* `split_transcript` added to split a transcript style vector (e.g.,
  `c("greg: Who me", "sarah: yes you!")` into a name and dialogue vector that is
  coerced to a `data.table`.

* `change_index` added  for extracting the indices of changes in runs within an
  atomic vector.  Pairs well with `split_index`.

* `bind_vector` added to `cbind` a named atomic `vector`'s names and values.

* `bind_table` added to `cbind` a `table`'s names and values.

* `duration` method for numeric vectors added as well as a `starts` and `ends`
  function for calculating start and end times from a numeric vector.

* `from_to` added to prepare speaker data for a network lot given the flowing
  nature of discourse.

* `tidy_dtm` & `tidy_tdm` added to convert a `DocumentTermMatrix`
  or `TermDocumentMatrix` into a tidied `data.frame`.

* `tidy_colo_dtm` & `tidy_colo_tdm` added to convert a `DocumentTermMatrix`
  or `TermDocumentMatrix` into a collocation matrix and then a tidied `data.frame`.

* `unique_pairs` added to compliment the output of `tidy_colo_dtm` &
  `tidy_colo_tdm`.  Enables the removal of duplicated collocating pairs caused
  by symmetrical mirroring of the upper and lower triangle of the collocation
  matrix.

CHANGES

* `split_index` now uses `change_index(x)` as the default when `x` is an atomic
  vector.


textshape 0.0.1
